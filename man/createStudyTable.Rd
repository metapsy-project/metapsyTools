createStudyTable(.data, ...,
                 .round.by.digits = NULL,
                 .column.names = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Meta-analysis study data. Typically data created by the
\code{\link{expandMultiarmTrials}} or \code{\link{calculateEffectSizes}} function.
Trial arm-specific information (e.g. sample size in each group) can be added via
\code{\link{addTrialArmInfo}}. See 'Details'.}

\item{...}{<\link[dplyr]{dplyr_data_masking}>. The name of several columns
(included in \code{.data}) that should be added to the study table. Also allows to
alter individual values/factor labels within a variable. See 'Details'.}

\item{.round.by.digits}{named \code{list}. Should contain the number of digits by which to
round a numeric column in \code{.data}. The name of the column must be specified in the
list element's name. Set to \code{NULL} if no rounding should be performed (default).}

\item{.column.names}{named \code{list}. If variable names should be renamed when producing the
study table, the new name should be included in this list. The original column name must
be specified as the name of the list element. Set to \code{NULL} if no renaming should
be performed (default).}

\item{.na.replace}{\code{character} to replace \code{NA} values with; \code{"nr"} by
default.}

\item{.html}{\code{logical}. Should an HTML table be produced? \code{TRUE} by default. See
'Details'.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame} with all the selected variables. If \code{.html} is
\code{TRUE}, an HTML table will also be produced.
}
\description{
This function creates an overview table containing selected study information.
}
\details{
\strong{General Purpose}: This function allows to select variables to be included in a study table.
Such study tables are typically part of a meta-analysis report/article. Variables are
included by adding their names to the function call and separating
them with commas. The columns will appear in the exact same order as specified in
the function.

\strong{Trial-Arm Variables}: Before producing the final table, \code{createStudyTable} will filter out all redundant
rows based on the selected variables. If you want to include information that differs
between the (two or more) trial arms (e.g. the sample size of each group) as separate columns, you have to
use \code{\link{addTrialArmInfo}} first. This ensures that individual columns are created
for both the intervention and control group (e.g. \code{N_ig} and \code{N_cg}),
which can then be included in the call to \code{createStudyTable}.


\strong{Changing Values}: The function also allows to change specified values within a variable. Factor levels
encoded as numbers, for example (e.g. \code{country = 1} for European studies, and so
forth) can be changed by adding a concatenated (\code{\link[base]{c}}) vector to the
name of the variable. This vector should contain the \emph{new} value as a \code{character}
on the \emph{left} side, and the \emph{old} value on the \emph{right} side,
separated by '\code{=}' (e.g. \code{country = c("Europe" = "1")}).
The values will then be recoded before producing the table.

\strong{HTML Table}: By default, \code{createStudyTable} produces an HTML table using
\code{\link[knitr]{kable}}. The HTML table makes copy & paste easier, particularly
when working with MS Word, since the table formatting is kept.
