\arguments{
\item{data}{Meta-analysis data stored as a \code{data.frame}.}

\item{vars.for.id}{\code{character} vector, containing column names of all variables used to construct unique comparison IDs.}

\item{study.indicator}{\code{character}, signifying the name of the variable containing the study name.}

\item{multiarm.indicator}{\code{numeric}, signifying if a row is part of a multiarm study (1) or not (0).}

\item{no.arms.indicator}{\code{character}, signifying the name of the variable containing the number of arms included in a study (typically 2).}

\item{group.indicator}{\code{character}, column name of the variable storing the study name.}

\item{condition.specification}{\code{character}, column name of the variable storing the trial condition name.}

\item{groups.column.indicator}{\code{character}. If the dataset is in wide format: a character vector with two elements, representing the suffix used to
differentiate between the first and second treatment in a comparison.}

\item{group.names}{\code{list}, storing the name of the value corresponding to the intervention group (\code{"ig"}) and control group (\code{"cg"}).}

\item{data.format}{\code{character}. Either \code{"long"} or \code{"wide"}, depending on the format of the dataset in
\code{data}. \code{NULL} by default, which lets the user define the format after the function has been called.}
}
\value{
\code{expandMultiarmTrials} returns the meta-analysis data set as class \code{data.frame} (if results are saved to a variable). The rows of multiarm studies are expanded so that each intervention group has an unambiguously assigned control group. It also generates the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{id} a \emph{comparison}-specific ID variable.}
\item{\code{study.id} a \emph{study}-specific ID variable.}
\item{\code{study} a study-specific variable containing the study name. For multiarm studies, this variable also specifies the active treatment indicated by \code{multiarm.group.indicator} behind the name of the study (e.g. \code{"Hauksson, 2017 -grp"}).}
}
}
\description{
This is a function to expand the format of meta-analysis data for its applicability to the \code{calculateEffectSizes} function of the \code{metapsyTools}-package.
}
\details{
This function expands multiarm studies in a meta-analysis data set, thereby ensuring that each comparison (intervention group vs. control group in \code{condition}) is unique for a specific outcome, and thus has two rows. For this purpose, it duplicates the corresponding row of the control group condition if required. A specific study indicator variable is created that enables further use, e.g. in 3-level models.
For more details see the help vignette: \code{vignette("metapsyTools")}.
