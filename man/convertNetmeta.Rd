\arguments{
\item{mean_arm1}{Mean score in the first trial arm.}

}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame} in wide-format, containing the calculated effect sizes
(standardized mean differences, SMDs) for each required comparison. The following
columns will be included in all outputs:
\itemize{
\item \code{studlab}: Study label for each comparison. If response counts were used as outcome,
"\code{(response)}" is appended to the study name.
\item \code{treat1}: Condition or format used in the first trial arm.
\item \code{treat2}: Condition or format used in the second trial arm.
\item \code{TE}: The calculated effect size (SMD).
\item \code{seTE}: Standard error of the calculated effect size.
}

Depending on whether continuous or binary outcomes (or both) were used,
the dataset will also include further columns containing the raw data used
to obtain the effect size:
\itemize{
\item \code{n1}: Sample size in the first trial arm.
\item \code{n2}: Sample size in the second trial arm.
\item \code{mean1}: Mean (change) scores in the first trial arm.
\item \code{mean2}: Mean (change) scores in the second trial arm.
\item \code{sd1}: Standard deviation in the first trial arm.
\item \code{sd2}: Standard deviation in the second trial arm.
\item \code{event1}: Responders in the first trial arm.
\item \code{event2}: Responders in the second trial arm.
}

Studies for which effect sizes could not be calculated will be saved as
a character vector in the \code{removed.studies} attribute. They can be extracted
using \code{attr(res, "removed.studies")}, where \code{res} is the returned data frame.

\description{
This function converts a database following the
\href{https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/}{Metapsy data standard}
into format that is suitable for network meta-analysis (e.g. using \code{\link[netmeta:netmeta]{netmeta::netmeta()}}).
}
\details{
This function converts a Metapsy database into a "wider" format dataset that can be used to
run network meta-analyses. Returned objects are optimized for \code{\link[netmeta:netmeta]{netmeta::netmeta()}} and can
be used "out-of-the box" in this package.

The function will perform an expansion of multi-arm trials, which is required
for most network meta-analysis implementations. Thus, the function will calculate all
three unique comparisons for three-arm trials, all six comparisons for four-arm trials,
etc.

Two additional formatting requirements must be met to conduct the conversion:
\itemize{
\item Each comparison in a trial is only allowed to provide exactly one effect size/contrast.
This may be resolved by filtering the dataset beforehand using \link{filterPoolingData} or
\link{filterPriorityRule}. The function will return an informative error message if
non-unique comparisons are found.
\item The function can only use raw continuous outcome and binary response data to calculate SMDs for
each comparison. Rows with other effect size information (e.g. pre-calculated effects based on
\emph{t} or \emph{F}-tests) will not be included. If comparisons had to be removed, affected studies will
be printed into the console and should be added manually.
}

It is also possible to add additional columns (e.g., columns included in the dataset provided in \code{data}) to
the final data frame. These columns have to be specified as additional arguments
in the function call, where the argument name will be used as the column name (see Examples).
