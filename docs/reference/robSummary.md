# Create a RevMan-style risk of bias summary chart

This function generates summary plots for study quality assessments
using the [Cochrance Risk of Bias Tool](https://bit.ly/2KGQtfG). Summary
plots follow the style of [RevMan](https://bit.ly/30eJK29) Risk of Bias
(RoB) summary charts.

## Usage

``` r
robSummary(data, name.high="High", name.unclear="Unclear",
    name.low="Low", studies, name.missing, table = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `data.frame` containing a column for each risk of bias criterion,
  where rows represent each individual studies. The risk of bias
  assessment for each criterion in each study must be coded as a
  character string. Up to four codes can be used, referring to low risk
  of bias, unclear risk of bias, high risk of bias, or missing
  information. The string used to specify the categories must be
  specified in `name.high`, `name.unclear`, `name.low` and/or
  `name.missing`, unless defaults for those parameters are used.

- name.high:

  Character specifying how the "high risk of bias" category was coded in
  `data` (e.g., `name.high = "high"`). Default is `"High"`.

- name.unclear:

  Character specifying how the "unclear risk of bias" category was coded
  in `data` (e.g., `name.unclear = "unclear"`). Default is `"Unclear"`.

- name.low:

  Character specifying how the "low risk of bias" category was coded in
  `data` (e.g., `name.low = "low"`). Default is `"Low"`.

- studies:

  A vector of the same length as the number of rows in `data` specifying
  the study labels for the risk of bias ratings. Only has to be
  specified when `table = TRUE`.

- name.missing:

  Character specifying how missing information was coded in `data`
  (e.g., `name.missing` = `"missing"`). Default is `"Missing"`. All
  ratings, including missing information, must be coded as strings, so
  using `NA` in `data` to signify missing information is not valid.

- table:

  Should an additional RevMan style risk of bias table be produced? If
  set to `TRUE`, `studies` must be specified. `FALSE` by default.

## Details

The function automatically removes separators like "-" or "." from
column names/risk of bias criteria. To produce a "clean" plot, you may
therefore separate words in the column names of the `data` data frame
using these symbols (e.g. `"Allocation_Concealment"` to return
"Allocation Concealment").
